    <i>
    Ketogenic or keto meal plans have been used by medical professionals for nearly 100 years to manage certain medical conditions. But more recently, the eating style has become popular among dieters looking to lose weight and athletes looking to improve performance. Before you decide to follow the program, take some time to evaluate a typical keto diet meal plan to make sure that it is an eating style that you can maintain for the long term.</i>
<br><br>
<h2>
What Is a Keto Diet Plan?
</h2>
<br><br>
A ketogenic diet, or keto diet, is a very low carbohydrate eating plan that forces the body to use fat rather than glucose as a primary energy source. When you follow the plan, you build meals around fatty foods and significantly restrict your intake of carbohydrates and protein. As a result of that macronutrient balance, acids called ketones are produced in the body. When ketone levels are high enough, the dieter is in a state of ketosis.
<br><br>
There are different reasons that people might use a keto meal plan. Some athletes use it to lower body fat and improve sports performance. Keto diets may be used to improve certain medical conditions such as epilepsy or neurologic illnesses. Some dieters also use ketogenic diets to lose weight.
<br><br>
<h2>How to Use a Keto Diet Plan</h2><br><br>
The experts who supplied ketogenic meal plans for this article work with clients to reach specific sports, health, and wellness goals. Your goals might be different and your health history may require that you eat different foods than those suggested here.
<br><br>
Use these meal plans to get an idea of what eating a keto diet looks like. Evaluate each day's meals and think about whether or not the foods look palatable and if the eating style seems manageable. If you decide that you think you'd like to try the eating style, connect with a nutrition or medical professional to create a plan that is personalized for you.
<br><br>
<h2>Keto Diet Meal Plan #1</h2>
<br><br>
The first sample keto diet plan comes from a full-time adventurer and elite athlete who uses the eating style to improve and maintain his sports performance. Patrick Sweeney also lectures on the ketogenic diet at conferences around the country and coaches others to adopt a life of adventure.
<br><br>
His sample meal plan is great for people who like to cook and experiment in the kitchen.

<h2>Keto Diet Meal Plan #1</h2>
<br><br>
Breakfast: Adventure coffee (a unique recipe that combines coffee with coconut oil, heavy cream, an egg, butter, and occasionally cocoa powder) alone, or add breakfast cheese blintzes. Mix a cup of cream cheese with three egg whites in a blender. Cook the blintzes like pancakes, then add cream cheese and smoked salmon, or fresh raspberries.
Mid morning snack: Full fat greek yogurt
Lunch: Green salad with either salmon, chicken, or grilled shrimp and cheese.
Afternoon snack: Apple with almond butter
Dinner: Grilled salmon, spinach, green beens or cauliflower baked with shredded cheddar cheese.
Dessert: One square of dark ( >72 percent cacao) chocolate
<br><br>
<h2>
Keto Diet Day Two</h2>
<br><br>
Breakfast: Adventure coffee alone or add volcano eggs. Whip two egg whites to standing, top with a piece of smoked salmon and a few spinach leaves. Grate cheddar cheese on top and indent the top with a spoon. Bake for 5 minutes at 350 then put the yoke in the indent and let it drizzle down the browned sides.
Mid-morning snack: Goat's milk yogurt with a handful of almonds
Lunch: Goat cheese salad with walnuts and bacon
Afternoon snack: Almonds
Dinner: Turkey chili with beans, onions, tomatoes, peppers and grated cheddar cheese. Optional: add a fried egg on top. Eat with a side salad.
<br><br>
<h2>
Keto Diet Day Three</h2>

Breakfast: Adventure coffee alone or with a nutrient dense omelette. Saute garlic, red and green peppers, cherry tomatoes and avocado in a pan. When they are lightly cooked, take them out, add olive oil and mix in two eggs for an omelette. Add your favorite cheese and fresh spinach.
Mid-morning snack: Apple with peanut butter
Lunch: Leftover chili from the previous night
Afternoon snack: Brie and a Wasa cracker (a very low carbohydrate cracker)
Dinner: Duck on the barbecue with grilled eggplant and zucchini
<br><br>
Macronutrient Balance
<br><br>
Sweeney does not stick to a specific macronutrient balance when he begins his own ketogenic diet plan. Instead, he maintains a diet that includes no more than 50 grams of carbohydrate per day. When he goes over .6 on the ketone meter (a device used to measure blood for the presence of ketones) he goes up to 70 grams of carbohydrates and takes a ketone supplement.
<br><br>
Keto Meal Plan Tips:
<br><br>
To maintain the keto eating style Sweeney suggests these these guidelines:
<br><br>
Look at the glycemic index to choose the best foods for your ketogenic meal plan. There are websites that provide the glycemic index (GI) or glycemic load of different foods. The glycemic index tells you how your body's glucose and insulin system will respond to different foods. Foods that are lower on the index (or have a lower glycemic load) are foods that digest more slowly and will help you to feel full for a longer period of time.
<br><br>
A glass of organic red wine is okay if consumed just a couple of times per week. Alternatively, you might enjoy two shots of tequila and two limes mixed with soda water.
<br><br>
Choose foods that take longer to digest and that have lots of nutrient density. But they should also be foods you like or you'll be unhappy eating them and you'll be less likely to stick to the diet.
<br><br>

Trying to lose weight with exercise and starting a keto diet at the same time can provide fast results for a "multiplier" effect. However, if you haven't exercised in more than 6 months, you should wait to start the keto eating plan. Begin an exercise program first so you are adapting to only one physical change at a time. After 2 weeks of working out 3-4 times per week, you should be ready to start the keto diet.
<br><br>
Experiment with intermittent fasting, especially before working out. For example, eat dinner early (6:30 or 7pm) then go to bed without eating. Work out first thing in the morning before you eat. Start your day with breakfast and adventure coffee.

<h2>
  The Paleo Diet - A Beginner's Guide Plus Meal Plan</h2>
  <br><br>

  <img src="http://riteshbawri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paleo-diet.jpg" width="65%"><br><br>

<p align="left">  
The paleo diet is based on emulating the diet of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. It includes whole, unprocessed foods that resemble their original nature.
<br>
Our ancestors were genetically the same as modern humans. 
<br>
</p>

<h2>A Paleo Diet Meal Plan </h2><br>

<p align="left"> 
There is no one "right" way to eat for everyone and paleolithic humans thrived on a variety of diets, depending on what was available at the time.
<br><br>
Some ate a low-carb diet high in animal foods, others a high-carb diet with lots of plants.
<br>
Consider this as a general guideline, not something written in stone. You can adapt all of this to your own personal needs and preferences.
<br><br>
The Basics<br><br>
Eat: Meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, healthy fats and oils.
<br><br>
Avoid: Processed foods, sugar, soft drinks, grains, most dairy products, legumes, artificial sweeteners, vegetable oils, margarine and trans fats.
<br><br>
</p>
<h2>
Avoid These Foods </h2><br><br>
Avoid these foods and ingredients:
<br><br>

<p align="left"> 
<B>Sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup:</B> Soft drinks, fruit juices, table sugar, candy, pastries, ice cream and many others.<br>
<B>Grains: </B>Includes breads and pastas, wheat, spelt, rye, barley, etc.<br>
<B>Legumes:</B> Beans, lentils and many more.<br>
<B>Dairy:</B> Avoid most dairy, especially low-fat (some versions of paleo do include full-fat dairy like butter and cheese).<br>
<B>Vegetable Oils:</B> Soybean oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil and others.<br>
<B>Trans Fats:</B> Found in margarine and various processed foods. Usually referred to as "hydrogenated" or "partially hydrogenated" oils.<br>
<B>Artificial Sweeteners:</B> Aspartame, Sucralose, Cyclamates, Saccharin, Acesulfame Potassium. Use natural sweeteners instead.<br>
<B>Highly Processed Foods:</B> Everything labelled "diet" or "low-fat" or has many weird ingredients. Includes artificial meal replacements.<br>
<b>
A simple guideline: If it looks like it was made in a factory, don't eat it!</b>
<br><br>
If you want to avoid these ingredients, then you MUST read ingredients lists, even on foods that are labelled as "health foods."
</p>
<h2>
Foods to Eat on The Paleo Diet<br><br></h2>
<b>
Base your diet on these real, unprocessed paleo foods.</b>

<p align="left"> 
<br><br>
Meats: Beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, pork and others.
Fish and Seafood: Salmon, trout, haddock, shrimp, shellfish, etc. Choose wild-caught if you can.

<h2>6 Steps to New Habits</h2><br><br>


<p align="left">
Use the habit loop to establish new daily habits that will help to achieve a desired outcome. Follow a six-step approach to creating new, goal-oriented habits with your clients.<br><br>
</p>

<b>Step 1: Establish Goals and Milestones</b><br><br>
<p align="left">
Contrary to popular belief, habits do not take 21 days to form. The time varies greatly from person to person and can be as long as 66 days on occasion (Gardner, Lally & Wardle 2012). The automaticity of habit formation is a long process that requires consistent implementation and coaching. It’s therefore important to set expectations about the journey. Focus and buy-in are paramount for habit formation and retention.<br><br>

Our clients often come to us with ambitious goals, like losing 60 pounds, becoming a starting quarterback, or lowering blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk. These objectives can seem overwhelming. Once a client’s goal is established, it’s important to “chunk” it into smaller, less daunting, more realistic outcomes. For example, instead of focusing on losing 60 pounds, a good first milestone is to lose 5 pounds in the first month. Establishing milestones helps the client manage expectations, which increases the likelihood that a habit will form.<br><br>
</p>
<b>Step 2: Identify Motivational Factors</b><br><br>
<p align="left">
To be motivated means to be moved to do something (Ryan & Deci 2000). Motivation can be both intrinsic and extrinsic. The client who wants to lose 60 pounds may have been told by her doctor that she might die if she doesn’t lose weight. This scare tactic is an extrinsic motivator—the motivation comes from an external driver. This form of motivation is a powerful way to get someone started on a new behavior, but the long-term effectiveness is poor.<br><br>

Intrinsic motivation involves doing an activity for the inherent satisfaction, not for a separable consequence. Losing weight may be intrinsically important to the client because she gains a sense of accomplishment, feels more self-confident, finds a mate or accelerates her career. Intrinsic motivators are long-lasting compared with extrinsic factors.<br><br>

Motivational factors are closely linked to cues and rewards, and identifying them influences the habit loop. Motivational interviewing tactics such as expressing empathy, establishing rapport and assessing readiness to change are useful for identifying motivational factors (Bundy 2004). (See the sidebar “Four Motivational Interviewing Techniques” for more.)<br><br>
</p>
<b>Step 3: Pick a Goal-Oriented Behavior</b><br><br>
<p align="left">
Parents struggle to get their kids to eat vegetables. The reward (“Vegetables are good for you”) is not valuable for most children, and attempts to force vegetables on them will often meet with strong resistance. Autonomy is a powerful tool for stimulating behavior change and sustaining it over time (Ryan et al. 2011). It’s a parent’s dream to have a child eat veggies of her own accord. Likewise, personal trainers dream of a client who makes healthy decisions on his own. Here’s a key: In order for clients to establish a habit, they must select the habit.<br><br>

Let’s go back to the kids and vegetables example. To get your child to eat her veggies, you must give her the power of choice. Before dinner, select three green vegetables for her to choose from: kale, green beans or broccoli. She picks the one that sounds most appealing, and because she was given the power to select it ahead of time, she becomes more likely to eat a vegetable with less resistance in the future.<br><br>

When working with a client, select two to three goal-oriented habits, provide the rationale for how each habit supports the goal and then give the client the power of choice. While it might seem appealing to engage in multiple habits at one time, focusing on one simple habit at a time may lead to greater behavior change (Gardner, Lally & Wardle 2012). For example, give a weight loss client three habits along with their benefits:<br><br>

Walk and track 10,000 steps per day. There is evidence that regular, “incidental” physical activity is effective for weight loss and overall health.<br>
Drink 2 cups of water before every meal. Not only can this help with satiety, but water is calorie-free, and proper hydration may aid in fat loss and contribute to overall well-being.<br>
Get to bed by 10 p.m. every night. A good night’s sleep supports the body’s ability to lose weight.
The client selects the habit he wants to focus on first, which creates a sense of ownership.<br><br>
</p>
<b>Step 4: Create the Cue and Reward</b><br><br>
<p align="left">
Once the client has selected a behavior, provide a few potential cues that will trigger it. For instance, if the client opts to drink two cups of water before every meal, offer the following cues to choose from:<br><br>

Set a reminder alarm.<br>
Keep a water bottle next to the computer screen.<br>
Schedule water consumption on a calendar.<br>
Next, help the client select a reward to reinforce the behavior. The more valuable the reward (the more intrinsically and extrinsically motivating it is), the more likely the client will be to engage in the behavior the next day. For example, if the client meets the goal by dinner, he can have one glass of wine. While it can be argued that alcohol consumption could impede the client’s weight loss goal, it’s perhaps more important for him to feel that he can successfully accomplish a new behavior and form a healthy habit (Gardner, Lally & Wardle 2012).<br><br>
